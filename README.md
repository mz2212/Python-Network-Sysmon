Python-Network-Sysmon

A neat little pair of python scripts to get the cpu usage of one machine, and send it to a raspberry pi with an Adafruit-LCD-Plate attached to it, and display the cpu usage on that display.
It really could be retrofitted to display anything the client pleases on the LCD.
Enjoy!
